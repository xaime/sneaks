Snooping Early Alert Knowledge Service



An attack on an organization information system begins with information gathering on it. This activity consists of several phases, one of which is the investigation of the people in the organization. This information will be useful to the attacker in subsequent steps. However, this phase is not monitored by organizations.



In this project some detectable signs of this investigation of individuals are identified, and an application that collects this evidence and is able to issue an early warning of footprinting, named Sneaks, is under developement.
Sneaks runs as a service that uses specialized sensors, each for one type of evidence, which establish a level of the footprinting of the organization and monitor it periodically to issue a report when a preset threshold is exceeded. 




Sneaks is well documented, but unfortunately all the documents are still in Spanish. Soon I will add more documentation on the development of sneaks and their use, according to their evolution and the need for translation of existing documentation.
